El Cajon, Spanish for ""the drawer,"" was first recorded on September 10, 1821, as an alternative name for sitio rancho Santa M√≥nica to describe the ""boxed in"" nature of the valley in which it sat.

In 1905, the name was once again expanded to ""El Cajon"" under the insistence of California banker and historian Zoeth Skinner Eldredge.

The European settlement was started by refugee Huguenots (French Protestants) in 1688, who were fleeing religious persecution in France (such as Dragonnades) after the king's revocation of the Edict of Nantes.

== History ==

There is archeological evidence, from about 12,000 years ago, of the presence of Paleo Indians in the Gainesville area, although it is not known if there were any permanent settlements. A Deptford culture campsite existed in Gainesville and was estimated to have been used between 500 BCE and 100 CE. The Deptford people moved south into Paynes Prairie and Orange Lake during the first century and evolved into the Cades Pond culture.",197720,10.14455474,48.55152954,12.43077235,7.020153665,7.468058656,58.4850398,5.104173756,54.22090864,21.19343727,2,36.42656587,58.97130768,0.078595163,4618.194721,FL,133997,low,0.564256,medium,63.28942144,high,26431,low,416053.5785,medium,2,58.97130768,Left,82.3,high,2582.813573,medium,70.2,low,7.4,medium,67.3,medium,34.89059985,low,Medium Metro Area,189,366,93,540,521.5,244,84,291,185,554,54,93,682.5

== History ==
Archaeological evidence suggests the San Francisco Bay Area has been inhabited as early as 2700 BC. People of the Ohlone language group probably occupied Northern California from at least the year 500 A.D. Though their territory had been claimed by Spain since the early 16th century, they would have relatively little contact with Europeans until 1769, when, as part of an effort to colonize Alta California, an exploration party led by Don Gaspar de Portol√° learned of the existence of San Francisco Bay. Seven years later, in 1776, an expedition led by Juan Bautista de Anza selected the site for the Presidio of San Francisco, which Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Moraga would soon establish.",486010,34.52490103,35.82824996,14.64316567,5.588191819,11.37213306,52.94863511,3.301998645,42.80276084,1.891012748,1,18.42619217,75.66606443,0.035389489,8143.824983,CA,106280,low,0.704088,high,62.15354939,high,53516,high,733677.9264,high,1,75.66606443,Left,68.2,medium,1501.342589,low,80.5,medium,13,medium,24.7,low,39.58982601,medium,Large Metro Area,268,22.5,121.5,7.5,217,28.5,395,71.5,73,28.5,643.5,121.5,402.5
